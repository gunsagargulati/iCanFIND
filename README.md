An approach to identify alteration frequency, annual incidence, and co-occurring drug targetable alteration in inoperable cancers, as a standalone web application available at https://icanfind.shinyapps.io/home.

The data analyzed in this study were obtained from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), cBioPortal, and American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Project GENIE database. SEER incidence and demographic data was downloaded from www.seer.cancer.gov. TCGA mutation files and clinical data were downloaded using the TCGAbiolinks R package (version 2.23.4) and ‘GDCquery’ and ‘GDCdownload’ functions. Copy number and structural variants data from TCGA was obtained from www.cbioportal.org. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) mutation, copy number, structural variant, and clinical data were extracted from the AACR Project GENIE database using the Sage Bionetworks platform (www.synapse.org/genie).
